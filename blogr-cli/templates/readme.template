## Getting Started

This blog is built with Blogr, a CLI static site generator that focuses on simplicity and developer experience.

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (for building Blogr from source)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional, for easier deployment)

### Development

1. **Create a new post:**
   ```bash
   blogr new "My New Post"
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   blogr serve
   ```
   This will start a local server with live reload at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Build the static site:**
   ```bash
   blogr build
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   blogr deploy
   ```

### Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ blogr.toml          # Configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ posts/              # Blog posts (Markdown files)
â”œâ”€â”€ static/             # Static assets (images, CSS, JS)
â”œâ”€â”€ themes/             # Custom theme files (optional)
â””â”€â”€ dist/               # Generated static site (after build)
```

### Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown and should be placed in the `posts/` directory. Each post should have front matter with metadata:

```markdown

title: "My Blog Post"
date: "2024-01-15"
author: "Your Name"
description: "A brief description of the post"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
status: "published"  # or "draft"
---

# Your Post Content

```
