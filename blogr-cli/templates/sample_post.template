# Welcome to {blog_title}!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully set up your new blog with **Blogr**. This is your first blog post, and it's here to help you understand how everything works.

## What is Blogr?

Blogr is a modern CLI static site generator specifically designed for blogs. It focuses on:

- **Simplicity** - Easy to use command-line interface
- **Speed** - Fast builds and optimized output
- **Developer Experience** - Live reload, hot reloading, and great tooling
- **Themes** - Beautiful, customizable themes
- **GitHub Integration** - Seamless deployment to GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

Here are some commands to help you get started:

### Create a New Post

```bash
blogr new "My Second Post"
```

This will create a new markdown file in your `posts/` directory with the proper front matter.

### Start Development Server

```bash
blogr serve
```

This starts a local development server with live reload. Any changes you make to your posts or configuration will automatically update in your browser.

### Build Your Site

```bash
blogr build
```

This generates the static files for your blog in the `dist/` directory.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
blogr deploy
```

This builds and deploys your site to GitHub Pages automatically.

## Writing Posts

All your blog posts go in the `posts/` directory as Markdown files. Each post needs **front matter** at the top with metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
author: "Your Name"
description: "Brief description for SEO and previews"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
status: "published"  # or "draft"
slug: "url-friendly-slug"
featured: false      # Set to true for featured posts
---
```

### Supported Markdown Features

Blogr supports all standard Markdown features plus some extras:

- **Headers** - Use `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.
- **Links** - `[Link text](https://example.com)`
- **Images** - `![Alt text](path/to/image.png)`
- **Code blocks** - Syntax highlighting included
- **Tables** - Standard markdown table syntax
- **Lists** - Both ordered and unordered

### Code Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically highlighted:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Blogr!");
}
```

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Customizing Your Blog

### Theme Configuration

Your blog uses the **Minimal Retro** theme. You can customize colors, fonts, and other settings in your `blogr.toml` file:

```toml
[theme.config]
primary_color = "#FF6B35"
secondary_color = "#F7931E"
background_color = "#2D1B0F"
font_family = "Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace"
show_reading_time = true
show_author = true
```

### Static Files

Put images, custom CSS, JavaScript, and other static files in the `static/` directory. They'll be copied to your built site automatically.

## Project Structure

```
your-blog/
â”œâ”€â”€ blogr.toml          # Configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ posts/              # Your blog posts
